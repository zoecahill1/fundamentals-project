# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Assesment
This repository contains my solution for the assessment of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module in GMIT

## Instructions
This assessment concerns the well-known tips dataset and the Python packages seaborn and jupyter. It is broken into three parts, as follows.
1. (30%) Description: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within the repository, create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the tips dataset.
2. (30%) Regression: To the above jupyter notebook add a section that discusses and analyses whether there is a relationship between the total bill and tip amount.
3. (40%) Analyse: Again using the same notebook, analyse the relationship between the variables within the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish â€” for example, you may analyse all pairs of variables, or select a subset and analyse those.

## How to Download the Repository
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2. 7/ Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## How to View the Notebook
- Click on the numpy-random.ipynb file in the repository and GitHub will render the notebook for you.
- If the notebook does not render you can copy and paste the link of the numpy-random.ipynb file to the nbviewer site [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
- If you wish to run the notebook from your local machine:
	1. Follow the download instructions above.
	2. Open command line.
	3. Cd to where you downloaded the notebook.
	4. Type jupyter notebook to open the jupyter interface.
	5. Click on the numpy-random.ipynb file.

## Libraries Used 
1. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)Seaborn - is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
2. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
4. [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things; a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
5. [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) - is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration
